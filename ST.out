The data structure for the Symbol Table: 
It contains a hashtable implemented by me, which contains an array of strings. 
The position in the array signals the token index, all other positions are null. For the hashing function I used the one presented at the course.
The put method hashes the token, verifies if the position is empty or the token already exists and puts the token there. If it is not empty, it adds 1 to the index and tries again.
The get method hashes the token, looks if the hashed position has the token. If not, it adds 1 to the position and tries again.
